1. Start an app
2. Lorca load state and see if fresh or not (bootstrap or reload previous)
3. Proxy start. TODO: I suspect proxy needs to start before Locra. Sync, mux, chaining?
4. Once API gets event for trigger, send it to lorca. 

open question:
1. Does proxy process at this point needs anything from api? Can we deal with 1:1 mapping
